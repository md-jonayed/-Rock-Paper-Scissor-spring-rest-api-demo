* Why CORS @CrossOrigin is needed?
By default, browsers block cross-origin HTTP requests for security reasons. For example:

Your Spring Boot backend runs on http://localhost:8080

Your frontend (e.g., React, Angular, etc.) runs on http://localhost:3000

When your frontend tries to call the backend, the browser blocks it unless the backend explicitly allows it using CORS.

@RequestBody annotation converts JSON to Object or Object to JSON.
